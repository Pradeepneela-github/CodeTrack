            <h2 id="learning-summary">Concepts You’ve Learned (Git & GitHub)</h2>

            <p><b>Briefly explain the Git & GitHub concepts you’ve learned so far (like repository basics, status,
                    staging, commits, history, branching, merging, etc.).</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Git & GitHub Concepts – Simplified:</b></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Git: Git is like a security camera for your code. It records every change made—who did it, when, and what exactly was changed.</li>
			<li>GitHub: A cloud-based platform where you store Git repositories online. It’s like Google Drive for code, with collaboration features.</li>
			<li>Repository (Repo): Think of it like a project folder that stores your code and its entire history. Git tracks changes inside this folder.</li>
			<li>git status: Shows what’s going on—like asking, “What files did I change? What’s ready to save?”</li>
			<li>Staging (git add): Before saving changes, you “stage” them. It’s like putting items in a shopping cart before checkout.</li>
			<li>Commit (git commit): This is the actual save. You take a snapshot of your staged changes with a message explaining what you did.</li>
			<li>History (git log): Shows all past commits—who made them, when, and what changed. Like scrolling through your project’s timeline.</li>
			<li>Branching (git branch): Imagine you’re writing a book and want to try a new ending. You create a branch to experiment without touching the original.</li>
			<li>Merging (git merge): Once your changes are ready, you merge your branch back into the main one—like combining your new ending with the original story.</li>

		</ul>	

            <p>
                ✦ Imagine you’re explaining these ideas to a 10th-grade student, so use <b>simple words</b> and
                <b>easy-to-understand examples or analogies</b>.
                <br>✦ Also, think like a <b>DevOps/Cloud engineer</b> – sometimes applications fail, and while you may
                not fix
                the app code itself, you need to <b>look into code snippets, logs, or commit history</b> to understand
                what went wrong.
                <br>✦ For example: a wrong database connection string in code will show up in logs, and using Git
                history you can
                check <i>who changed it</i> and <i>when</i>.
            </p>

            <p><b>Your Task:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain Git concepts in your own words (as if teaching someone new).</li>
		<p><b>Git Concepts in Simple Words:</b></p>
			<li>Git is like a smart notebook for your code. Every time you make changes, Git lets you save a snapshot so you can go back if something breaks.</li>
			<li>Repository (repo): Think of it as a folder where your project lives, along with all its versions.</li>
			<li>Working Directory: This is the current state of your files—what you're editing right now.</li>
			<li>Staging Area: Before saving changes, you put them in a “waiting room” (staging). It’s like prepping files before hitting save.</li>
			<li>Commit: This is the actual save. You take a snapshot of your staged changes and write a short message explaining what you did.</li>
			<li>git status: Shows what’s changed, what’s staged, and what’s still waiting to be staged. Like checking your to-do list.</li>
			<li>git log: A timeline of all your commits—who made them, when, and what changed.</li>
			<li>Branch: A separate path where you can experiment without messing up the main code. Like writing a new chapter without changing the original story.</li>
			<li>Merge: Combines your branch back into the main code once everything works. Like adding your new chapter to the book.</li>
			<li>GitHub: An online place to store your Git repos, collaborate with others, and trigger automated tasks like testing and deployment.</li>
	</ul>

                <li>Connect at least one Git concept with a real-world debugging scenario.
                    <small>(e.g., “If an application suddenly stops connecting to the database, I can use
                        <code>git log</code> to
                        see if someone recently changed the configuration file.”)</small>
                </li>
                <li>Write 8–10 lines in simple language, add screenshots if possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="placeholder">[

<p><b>Real-Life Debugging Example:</b></p>
<ul> Imagine your app suddenly stops working—it can’t connect to the database. You check the logs and see an error: “Connection refused”. You suspect someone changed the database settings.
<li>Command: 'git log config/database.yml'</li>
<br>✦This shows who last edited the file and when.

<li>Command: 'git diff HEAD~1 HEAD'</li>
<br>✦Now you see the exact change—maybe someone accidentally typed the wrong password. You didn’t write the code, but Git helps you trace the issue like a detective.

Git Commands for Debugging
Command	What It Does	Real-Life Use Case
git log	Shows commit history	Check who changed a file and when. Useful when a config suddenly breaks.
git blame <file>	Shows who last edited each line	Find out who modified a specific line—like a broken database URL.
git diff	Shows changes between commits	Compare versions to see what was added, removed, or changed.
git show <commit>	Shows details of a specific commit	View the exact changes and message from a commit.
git checkout <commit>	Go back to a previous version	Temporarily switch to an older version to test if the issue existed then.
git bisect	Helps find which commit introduced a bug	Automates the search for the bad commit by testing versions step-by-step.
