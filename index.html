            <h2 id="learning-summary">Concepts You’ve Learned (Git & GitHub)</h2>

            <p><b>Briefly explain the Git & GitHub concepts you’ve learned so far (like repository basics, status,
                    staging, commits, history, branching, merging, etc.).</b></p>

            <p>
                ✦ Imagine you’re explaining these ideas to a 10th-grade student, so use <b>simple words</b> and
                <b>easy-to-understand examples or analogies</b>.
                <br>✦ Also, think like a <b>DevOps/Cloud engineer</b> – sometimes applications fail, and while you may
                not fix
                the app code itself, you need to <b>look into code snippets, logs, or commit history</b> to understand
                what went wrong.
                <br>✦ For example: a wrong database connection string in code will show up in logs, and using Git
                history you can
                check <i>who changed it</i> and <i>when</i>.
            </p>

            <p><b>Your Task:</b></p>
            <ul>
		    <b>Git & GitHub Concepts – Simplified:</b>

		    <li> Git: Git is like a security camera for your code. It records every change made- who did it, when, and what exactly was changed. </li>

		    <li> GitHub: A cloud-based platform where I store Git repositories online. It’s like Google Drive for code, with collaboration features. </li>
		    <li> Repository (Repo): Think of it like a project folder that stores my code and its entire history. Git tracks changes inside this folder. </li>
		    <li> git status: Shows what’s going on- like asking, “What files did I change? What’s ready to save?” </li>

		    <li> Staging (git add): Before saving changes, I “stage” them. It’s like putting items in a shopping cart before checkout. </li>

		    <li> Commit (git commit): This is the actual save. I take a snapshot of my staged changes with a message explaining what I did. </li>

		    <li> History (git log): Shows all past commits- who made them, when, and what changed. Like scrolling through your project’s timeline. </li>
		    <li> Branching (git branch): Imagine I’m writing a book and want to try a new ending. I create a branch to experiment without touching the original. </li>

		    <li> Merging (git merge): Once my changes are ready, I merge my branch back into the main one, like combining my new ending with the original story. </li>
 </li>

                Connect at least one Git concept with a real-world debugging scenario.
                    <small>(e.g., “If an application suddenly stops connecting to the database, I can use
                        <code>git log</code> to
                        see if someone recently changed the configuration file.")</small>
		    </li></ul>


            <p class="placeholder">

	    <h3>Real Life Debugging Example Using Git</h3>
	    <ul>

		    <li> When we work on real projects, issues can appear even if we did not write the code ourselves. Git can help us trace what changed, who changed it, and when it happened. Here is a simple example that new learners can easily understand. </li>

		    <li> Imagine my application suddenly stops working because it cannot connect to the database. The logs show an error saying "Connection refused". This usually means something in the database configuration might have been changed. </li>

		    <li> To investigate, I would start by checking the history of the configuration file. </li>


		
		    
		    <p>	<b> Step 1: Check who modified the file </b>
					<ul> Command:
						<code>["git log config/database.yml"]</code> </ul>
		    </p>

				<li> This command shows the list of commits that affected this file. It helps you see who last edited it and at what time. This is very useful when a configuration that was working earlier suddenly breaks. </li>

		
				<p>	<b> Step 2: Check what exactly changed </b>
					<ul> Command:  
						<code>["git diff HEAD~1 HEAD"]</code> </ul>
				</p>

				<li> This command compares the previous version of the file with the current one. It shows the exact lines that were added, removed, or updated. For example, you might discover that someone accidentally typed the wrong database password or changed the URL. </li>

				<li> Even if I were not the person who made the change, Git allows me to trace the issue step by step, almost like solving a small mystery. </li></ul>



<h3>Common Git Commands for Debugging</h3>

Here is a quick reference table that explains the most useful Git commands for debugging in a simple way.
